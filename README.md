Simple, easy, fast and very straightforward. The Bitcoin System had a total production and development cost of approximately 3.1 Bitcoins in today's values, January 2025.

I am making its complete code available to help the crypto community.

The ultra.cr file currently has 2.8 million verified wallets and all with balances updated in 2025. It is not free to make it available. The complete system with the ultra.vr and public.cr files can be purchased for 2,500 USDT to be sent to the wallet 0x1CE864dF66B44B22F22605b366Da928315A1ce17 (Ethereum ERC20 Network)
In case of payment, send the receipt to the email xlocgpu@gmail.com

Donations to help maintain the project can also be made to this same wallet in USDT or ETHEREUM

The system processes data in LOOP directly by the GPU and has the possibility of uploading both the ultra.cr file and the public.cr file to the GPU VRAM.

I also implemented some resources that can be used for the system to inform a WEB address if it finds a wallet. The system also has features to inform the ONLINE NEURAL NETWORK of the amount of data that each terminal is processing and whether the terminal is ACTIVE or INACTIVE.
BitcoinX also has an advanced feature to pay its collaborators with TOKENS or CRYPTOCURRENCIES.

The entire project is available on the website ultron2.com
